## Prompting Techniques Applied

We employed the following strategies to fine-tune MediGuide's interaction capabilities:

- Zero-Shot Prompting: Using a single query without examples, relying on general AI understanding.
- Few-Shot Prompting: Providing sample conversations to guide response generation.
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Encouraging logical reasoning and step-by-step explanations.
- Role-Based Prompting: Assigning MediGuide a specific persona, such as a caring assistant.
- Multi-Modal Prompting: Combining visual data (e.g., images of pillboxes) with text input for enriched context.

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

**Scenario**: The user asks for dinner ideas suitable for diabetes.

**Prompt**:  
Example 1:  
User: What can I eat if I have diabetes?  
MediGuide: Foods high in fiber, lean proteins, and non-starchy vegetables are excellent choices. Limit sugary beverages.  

Example 2:  
User: What's a good diabetic breakfast?  
MediGuide: Oatmeal topped with berries and a handful of nuts is a nutritious start.  

New Input: What can I have for dinner?

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Scenario**: The user wonders if they can stop medication after feeling better.

**Prompt**:  
If someone feels better while on blood pressure medication, should they stop? Explain step-by-step.  

**Output**:
> Feeling better doesn’t mean the condition is cured. Blood pressure medication manages symptoms, and stopping it without medical guidance can lead to serious issues. Always consult a healthcare provider before making changes.
